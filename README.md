○ How did you approach your task?
I learned from diverse web development tutorials on YouTube, combining HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a fully animated website.

Challenges included animating the background and handling overflow things like registration form overlap on background. 

○ And maybe even, a little bit about yourself :)
I'm a frontend web developer with six months of experience. Proficient in CSS, HTML, JavaScript, GSAP, and Locomotive, I've completed numerous projects, specializing in animations and web interactions.
